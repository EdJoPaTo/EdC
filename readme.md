# EMC - EdJoPaTos Media Converter

This tool helps with converting media from one format to another or compressing it.

There are already a bunch of tools out there doing exactly what it needed.
Remembering their command line can be annoying.
Especially when they are lacking features like multiple files at once.

Guiding principles:
- Use other tools (they know already how to do their job best)
- Never override the original
- Provide a way (--dry-run) to export a script to run yourself
